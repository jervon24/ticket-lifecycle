In this section of the lab, tickets were created. In the picture above, Aiden Mark, a manager at a finacial institution for instance created a ticket named; "Entire mobile banking system is down", to the IT department and added it to the critical business issues help topic. End users were reporting an issue when logging into their mobile banking app. Since this is a critical issue, it needs to be resolved as soon as possible and the images proceeding this will show the process on doing so.

In the image above, Josh which is an admin member, logged into osTicket in order to access and solve the issue since the ticket as assigned to him. The ticket priority was changed to emergency and is in the system administrator department. SLA plan "SEV A" was then added since this is a critical issue which needs to be resolved immediately as this could significantly impact the financial institution.
